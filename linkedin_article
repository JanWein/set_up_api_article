👨‍💻 If people are used to working with Excel, forcing them to switch to a different tool is not helpful.



✋ People may resist big changes because they are unsure how it will affect them, they do not see how it can be helpful, and they fear that it may lead to job loss.



👍 People will only support data-driven initiatives when they see the benefits for themselves in their own familiar environment and feel the positive effects personally. 



🙌 Then they will want and demand the necessary tools and infrastructure to support it.



🔨 But this cannot be achieved without effort.



💉 To catch the people it is necessary to provide small stimuli in a familiar environment to spark a desire for more.



⛔ Updating Excel files is a manual, time-consuming process that is prone to errors and takes people away from more meaningful work. 



📊 Even so, people still prefer to use Excel.



⚙ So let’s bring some automation to Excel by building an R Plumber API and using it in Excel.

😍 By using APIs in Excel, people can now work in their usual surroundings and focus on important tasks without being bothered by the boring and annoying stuff.



🙌 People are starting to understand how data-driven benefits them and they want more of it.



🛸 People then demand more sophisticated use cases beyond Excel.



🚀 This drives momentum on the journey to becoming a data-driven company.
