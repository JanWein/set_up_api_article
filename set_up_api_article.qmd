## Introduction

In order to transform people from opponents to supporters on the journey to becoming a data-driven company, it is important not to radically change everything about their usual way of working and their usual environment right away, but to provide them with small but key facilitations.

If people usually work with Excel, then taking Excel away from them and telling them that they should now work with a different, more suitable tool is not helpful.

They will resist it because they don't know what it means for them. They will be against it because they cannot imagine how it can be different, how it can be easier, how it can be more automated. They will be against it because they are afraid and think that "this AI" will take away their jobs.

They will only be on your side when they discover the benefits for themselves, when they feel and experience what data-driven means for them. Then they will develop a need for appropriate tools all by themselves and demand their introduction.

But this sense and understanding of data-drivenness won't happen on its own.

In a first step, this requires small impulses in the familiar environment that sow the seed of wanting more.

Everyone knows the manual, error-prone and time-consuming updating of Excel files.

Current figures are entered manually into the Excel spreadsheet on a daily basis and the calculations are updated accordingly.

This not only costs a lot of time, but is also prone to errors and keeps people from meaningful work and useful methodological development.

Nevertheless, people want to stay in their familiar Excel world for the time being.

So as a first step, let's bring some automation into this Excel world that brings people a little bit closer to data-drivenness and encourages them to develop a desire for more.

I will show in the following how you can build an API in R in just a few lines of code, deploy it with almost no effort, and how people can then use the API productively on their own in their familiar Excel environment.

## Building an API

first I build a simple API using the Plumber package. The Plumber Package makes it easy to turn R functions into web APIs. You simply have to add Roxygenlike comments (#\*) comments to the code and Plumber will do the rest. For demonstration purposes, I use the tidyquant package, which among other things allows to return stock quotes from Yahoo Finance. Then I describe the function with the Roxygenlike comments and it becomes an APi in a few lines of code.

``` {.r filename="Plumber.R"}
library(plumber)
library(tidyquant)
library(tibble)
library(magrittr)
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)

#* @apiTitle Stock Market Data API
#* @apiDescription Example of how to setup a Plumber API with just a few lines of code

#* Provide Stock Market Returns
#* @param symbol Ticker symbol (e.g. 'googl' for Alphabet, 'amzn' for Amazon ...)
#* @param from start date for the time series in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format. If not provided the start date is today minus 1 month. 
#* @param to end date for the time series in 'YYYY-DD-DD' format. If not provided, the end date is today.
#* @get /return
#* @serializer csv
financial_data <- function(symbol,from = today()-months(1),to = today()) {
  data <- tq_get(x = symbol, 
                 get = "stock.prices",
                 from = from,
                 to   = to)  %>% 
    arrange(date=desc(date))
  data 
}
```

You can now run the API locally to test it by clicking on the "Run API" button.

Once the API is working, we can move on to publishing the API.

## Publishing an API

### Posit Connect

The easiest way to make your own APIs available to others is to make the API available through Posit Connect. However, Connect is a commercial product and therefore not suitable and accessible for everyone. If Connect is available, the button to the right of the "Run API" button makes the API available through Connect with a few clicks.

### DigitalOcean

For this reason, I show another way to provide APIs to others. I use [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com) for this, where the API is hosted, and the plumberDeploy package, which allows this to be realized with minimal effort. We first need to create a DigitalOcean account and top it up with 5 USD, which can be done easily with PayPal. After that you have to connect the account to R using the `analogsea::account()` function.
